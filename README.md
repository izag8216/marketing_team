# AI Marketing Team App

## Overview
**AI Marketing Team is a web application that aims to provide comprehensive support for users' business marketing activities through the collaboration of six specialized AI agents: Orchestrator, Strategy Planner, Content Creator, SEO/SEM Specialist, Social Media Manager, and Data Analyst.**

This project builds an MVP demo site with an attractive landing page (LP) using HTML/CSS/JS to present this concept.
**The current primary purpose is to establish an AI-driven parallel development environment (Cursor, Claude Code, Git Worktree, tmux, GitHub Actions, etc.). The LP and agent management screen functionality is limited to displaying dummy data, and advanced backend features are not implemented.**
Local data.txt is assumed to handle CRUD operations (dummy functionality) for AI agent information.
